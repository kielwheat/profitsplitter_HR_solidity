# profitsplitter_HR

This repo contains three different solidity smart contracts to help build automated company profit splitting and equity plans.  There are three solidity files that can be used for different purposes by an HR/finance team.

AssociateProfitSplitter contract will divide Ether into the contract and divide it evenly among associate employees so that they can be paid by HR.

TieredProfitSplitter contract will work similarly to AssociateProfitSplitter but will divide profits unevenly by different tiers for CEO/CTO and a normal employee.

DeferredEquityPlan contract manages employee share distribution (1000 share default) over 4 years by setting and remembering the employee's owned and vetted future shares automatically.

Each contract has a series of screenshots showing how to deploy the contract and what successful transactions will look like upon completion.
